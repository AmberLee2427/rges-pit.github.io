RGES PIT stands for the **R**oman **G**alactic **E**xoplanet **S**urvey 
**P**roject **I**nfrastructure **T**eam. Formed in 2023, our NASA-funded team is
building the software and human infrastructure required to successfully execute the exoplanet component of the
GBTDS. The 2020 Decadal Survey states that Roman is *“the only platform in the coming decades 
that can produce a statistical census of planetary occurrence as a function of orbital 
separation and mass, from terrestrials to gas giants, beyond 1 AU”*.


The exoplanet survey will make use of Roman's wide-field instrument (WFI): The RGES PIT
has four major scientific and programmatic objectives:

* Confirm and/or reconfirm the five level-1 RGES science requirements
* Improve the microlensing event rate and yield calculations by improving the input Galactic models, 
incorporating new measurements of the near-infrared event rate obtained by the PRIME survey
* Develop and test the prototype photometry and astrometry pipeline, event detection pipeline, 
lightcurve modeling pipeline, and detection efficiency (or completeness) pipeline, with the goal of 
making these publicly-available and user-friendly
* Develop the occurrence rate formalism and methodology.
