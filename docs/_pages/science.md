title: "RGES Key Science Cases"
---

The RGES will address three key science objectives:

* **Microlensing Planets**: Completing the census of exoplanet systems in the Milky Way by discovering and characterizing
cold planets orbiting beyond their host stars snow line.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
* **Transiting Planets**: Discovery of up to 100,000 or more transiting exoplanets, increasing the current yield of transiting
planets by ~1.5 orders of magnitude.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
* **Free-Floating Planets**: Discovery and characterization of elusive free-floating planets. Current estimates predict between
200&mdash;1,000 free-floating planet detections during the nominal Roman microlensing survey.
