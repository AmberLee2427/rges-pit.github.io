The Euclid survey (right) contains 9 observations with the VIS instrument. The Roman footprints show varying observing strategies that are still to be decided by the project. </figcaption>

&nbsp;  
Two new surveys ([HST](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=17776){:target="_blank"} and Euclid) are currently being conducted in support of the RGES and broader science related to the Roman Galactic Bulge Time Doman Survey (GBTDS). Both programs are imaging the area of sky expected to be observed by the GBTDS. These precursor surveys are "single-epoch" snapshots, and will greatly strengthen Roman's ability to characterize detected exoplanet systems, as well as provide a rich and wide-field archive for use as Legacy datasets for the broader community.
