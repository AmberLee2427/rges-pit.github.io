## RGES PIT Members Lead Hubble and Euclid Precursor Bulge Surveys
March 23, 2025

<figcaption>Caption: The HST survey (left) contains 177 parallel observations with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The Euclid survey (right) contains 9 observations with the VIS instrument. The Roman footprints show varying observing strategies that are still to be decided by the project. </figcaption>

&nbsp;  
Two new surveys ([HST](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=17776){:target="_blank"} and Euclid) are currently being conducted in support of the RGES and broader science related to the Roman Galactic Bulge Time Doman Survey (GBTDS). Both programs are imaging the area of sky expected to be observed by the GBTDS. These precursor surveys are "single-epoch" snapshots, and will greatly strengthen Roman's ability to characterize detected exoplanet systems, as well as provide a rich and wide-field archive for use as Legacy datasets for the broader community.

## RGES PIT Members Spot a Candidate for the Speediest Exoplanet System
February 11, 2025

<figcaption>Caption: This artistâ€™s concept visualizes a super-Neptune world orbiting a low-mass star near 
the center of our Milky Way galaxy. RGES PIT members recently reported such a system that may break the current 
record for the fastest exoplanet system, traveling at least 1.2 million miles per hour, or 540 kilometers per 
second.</figcaption>

[This story](https://www.nasa.gov/universe/nasa-scientists-spot-candidate-for-speediest-exoplanet-system/){:target="_blank"} from 
NASA features an interview several RGES PIT members gave on a new study reporting a candidate 
for the highest velocity exoplanet system. The paper has been published in The Astronomical Journal, 
it can be found [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad9b0f/meta){:target="_blank"}.

&nbsp;  
The Exocast podcast sat down with RGES PIT member Eamonn Kerins to discuss microlensing searches for exoplanets, free-floating planets,
and dark matter. Kerins also discussed the upcoming Euclid Galactic Bulge Survey in preparation for the Roman GBTDS. The episode can be
streamed [here](https://www.exocast.org/exocast-78b/){:target="_blank"}.
