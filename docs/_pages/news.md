<figcaption>Caption: This artist’s concept visualizes a super-Neptune world orbiting a low-mass star near 
the center of our Milky Way galaxy. RGES PIT members recently reported such a system that may break the current 
record for the fastest exoplanet system, traveling at least 1.2 million miles per hour, or 540 kilometers per 
second.</figcaption>

NASA features an interview several RGES PIT members gave on a new study reporting a candidate 
for the highest velocity exoplanet system. The paper has been published in The Astronomical Journal,

&nbsp;  
The Exocast podcast sat down with RGES PIT member Eamonn Kerins to discuss microlensing searches for exoplanets, free-floating planets,
and dark matter. Kerins also discussed the upcoming Euclid Galactic Bulge Survey in preparation for the Roman GBTDS. The episode can be
streamed [here](https://www.exocast.org/exocast-78b/){:target="_blank"}.
